# GaonBoard
This repository is for GaonBoard soft keyboard application user issue management

**GaonBoard** is a free and open-source keyboard for Android 7.0+
devices. It aims at being modern, user-friendly and customizable while
fully respecting your privacy. Currently in early-beta state.

Original source code is from FlorisBoard(https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/)
We are devloping our own application based on FlorisBoard especially for the Korean Language Users.

## Highlighted features
- Integrated clipboard manager / history
- Advanced theming support and customization
- Integrated extension support (still evolving)
- Emoji keyboard / history / suggestions
- Speach Recognition
  
> [!NOTE]
> During the initial beta release phase, the Addons Store _will_ only accept theme extensions.
> Later on we plan to add support for language packs and keyboard extensions.
